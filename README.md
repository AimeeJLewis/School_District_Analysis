# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of our School District Analysis was to help Maria put together multiple dataframes of 15 high schools looking at math and reading grades, overall passing grades, spending analysis per school, etc. using Pandas and our Jupyter Notebook. Once that was completed, there was concern about academic dishonesty at Thomas High School's 9th Grade. We then were tasked with re-running the school district analysis without the 9th Grade at Thomas High School and determine how that affected our overall analysis.
## Results

Since there was only a total of (461) 9th Graders at Thomas High School out of the 39,170 students in total that were included, when we look at the overview for the entire district, the analysis was minimally affected by removing those 461 students grades.
