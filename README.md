# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of our School District Analysis was to help Maria put together a dataframe of 15 high schools looking at math and reading grades using Pandas and our Jupyter Notebook. Once that was completed, there was concern about academic dishonesty at Thomas High School's 9th Grade. We then were tasked with re-running the school district analysis without the 9th Grade at Thomas High School and determine how that affected our overall analysis.
